# testnet-genesis

This repository contains the Genesis files used for our public testnet. The latest version will always be updated and available in [latest](https://github.com/unification-com/testnet/tree/master/latest).  

Past genesis files will be placed in directories according to version numbers outside of `latest` for development and testing purposes.
